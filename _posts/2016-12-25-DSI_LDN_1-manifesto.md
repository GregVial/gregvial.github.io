We, the undersigned students of DSI-LDN-1, people of various origins, age and education, want to raise to the attention of GA management that we are dissatisfied with the following points:

- Dispartity of levels in the class: it appears expectations and prerequisites have not been properly set at recruitement time. As a result the class mixes people with no coding experience with seasoned developers, which makes it extremely hard to the teaching staff to deliver content efficiently
- Level of improvisation of the course: changing dates, last minute changes to the teaching staff, inadequate pedagogy of the teaching staff
- Value for money

We, however recognise some positive points in the course, such as content, projects and outcome programme.
This makes us moderately dissatisfied learners.

We, the undersigned customers of General Assembly, people of various origins, age and education, want to raise to the attention of GA management that we are dissatisfied with the following points:


- Refusal to share the survey outcome, and to discuss it openly in the class
- During individual interviews, denial that there is an issue and that the majority of the class is dissatisfied

Our request is the following:
- that GA stops denying that there is a problem with DSI_LDN_1
- that GA finally agrees to have a group discussion with our class
- that GA works on identifying acceptable solution to this situation

Signed (xxx out of 21)


### Principles
- We need to stay united
- We need to feel free to raise our voice to let our opinion hear
- Yet the majority vote might be required to make decision
- We want to achieve win-win, as opposed to win-lose
- We need to teachers on our side

### Objectives
- Prepare and sign manifesto asap
- Ideally hand it over on Friday at survey time
