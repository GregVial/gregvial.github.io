## Background
Anyone involved in machine learning has heard of the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), a repository of hand-written digits made famous by Yann LeCun, a pioneer in neural networks research.

The dataset contains 60,000 digitalized images of the digits from 0 to 9, and is frequently used for educational purposes, when learning how to program/train machine learning algorithm. It can be compared to the "Hello, world!" of neural nets, as telling a digit from another is often the first exercise performed when studying this field.

MNIST stands for MiniNIST and is a subset of a [large dataset](https://www.nist.gov/srd/nist-special-database-19) (released by the US National Institute of Standards and Technologies) containing all letters from the latin alphabet.

This larger dataset containing digits and letters has long been made available at a high cost. It can now be downloaded for free but is copyrighted by the U.S. Secretary of Commerce, so usage you can make of it is unclear.


## Introducing CoMNIST
CoMNIST is an attempt to create a totally free, distributable equivalent to NIST that also includes cyrillic alphabet on top of the latin alphabet.

It is distributed under [Creative Commons Attribyte/ShareAlike](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license, which means it can be freely shared, modified or used for commercial projects.

CoMNIST stands for Cyrillic-oriented MNIST, but "Co" also makes refrence to latin-root for "with", "together".

CoMNIST is (or will be) available on github at (https://github.com/GregVial/CoMNIST)




## Method
Let's look at a few features from our movie set.
