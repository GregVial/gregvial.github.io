<p>Anyone interested in data science should follow Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning course on &lt;a href=”https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning” Coursera&lt;/a&gt;.
Amongst all the training material available on the web, this is the one I find by far the most remarkable.</p>

<p>Andrew has an amazing ability to demystify all topics and turn them into something that seems simple and totally makes sense, even after watching the course video for the first time. And this is true this for audience with little or no prior knowledge of the area. If you consider the complexity of some of the algorithms, that’s quite a achievement.</p>

<p>What I admire most in his teaching style and I believe make it so successul are the following elements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Great structure. There is a very logical flow in the sequence things are being tought, and it helps with the learning process</li>
  <li>Great graphs. The frequent use of simple, well drawn graphs definitely helps a lot. In particular I find the use of color is pushed to the perfection. Don’t expect anything like Van Gogh though, the palette is a little bit more limited, with maybe just 3 or 4 different colors used, but with such mastery to show that elements or phenomena are connected or not is great</li>
  <li>Great explanations. Just what you need to understand. Nothing to add, nothing to throw away, every word is at the right place.</li>
</ul>

<p>But what I like more than everything else is that Andrew always starts with the <em>intuition</em>. In other words, regardless of what he explains, he first focuses on what is the idea behind what is being explained. Why do we even ask ourselves the question we are trying to elucidate? Why is it useful? What is a simple real example where we would meet this problem?</p>

<p>This makes a huge difference. If every teacher in the world was to get into the habit of explaining the intuition first, regardless of the subject they teach, this world would definitely be a better place to learn!</p>

As a side note, another very good set of <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">videos</a> I recommand watching is the ones recorded by Hastie and Tibshirani based on their book "An Introduction to Statistical Learning". They are also very clear, cover slightly different topics, and they have quite a bit of humor which I particularly enjoy (yes science can be fun).
